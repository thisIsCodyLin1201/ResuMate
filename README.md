ResuMate is a Python full-stack platform designed to solve the pain point of job seekers having to sift through massive numbers of openings. By combining automated resume parsing with real-time web crawling, the system calculates the match score between a user’s resume and job postings, then recommends the most suitable opportunities. A project file download link is also provided.
